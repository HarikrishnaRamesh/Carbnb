        <h1>About Our Site</h1>
        <p>Our site is the product of the idea of a new approach to the pre-existing problem of Car Rentals. Unlike the numerous existing and monotonous systems of registered drivers with their registered cars driving passengers around, our product is the optimal solution for tourists. Our system is depends on car owners who rent out their cars to tourists for their usage within registered dates. Since tourism agencies have group restrictions, and cab rentals have a fixed driver, our system provides the best of both worlds for tourists not requiring drivers and requiring to rent cars for a wide span of days.
